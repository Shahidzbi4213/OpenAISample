# OpenAISample
In this Android app, we leverage Jetpack Compose to create a simple user interface that allows users to generate text using an Open AI Completion model. Open AI Completion is an advanced machine learning model that can generate text based on a given input prompt. By integrating this model into our app, we can allow users to generate text in a wide range of contexts, from completing sentences and paragraphs to generating new ideas and concepts.

The user interface of the app consists of a single screen that allows users to input a prompt and generate text based on that prompt using the Open AI Completion model. The app uses Jetpack Compose to create UI components that are responsive and easy to use, with features like text input fields, buttons, and scrolling views.

To generate text using the Open AI Completion model, the app makes use of a backend service that hosts the model and exposes a REST API for generating text based on input prompts. The app sends the user's input prompt to the backend service, which in turn uses the Open AI Completion model to generate text and sends it back to the app for display.

In addition to generating text, the app includes features like sharing generated text and adjusting the settings for the Open AI Completion model. These features are implemented using Jetpack Compose components and make use of Android's built-in sharing and settings frameworks.

Overall, this app demonstrates how Jetpack Compose can be used to create modern, responsive Android user interfaces with advanced machine learning capabilities. With the power of Open AI Completion, users can generate text in a wide range of contexts, making this app a valuable tool for anyone looking to generate creative or informative content.
